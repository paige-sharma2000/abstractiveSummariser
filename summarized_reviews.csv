"It is extremely valuable for students to understand that Francis Galton is an important figure in forensic science and fingerprints, and his work is discussed at length within this module  - but as this resource explores, there are negative implications associated with his other ideas - particularly his founding of ""eugenics"" - that is, a process of human reproduction which involved increasing the occurance of 'desirable' characteristics. Galton's ideas on eugenics had underlying racist implications, advocating for Anglo-Saxons as the supposed superior race. After this death, policies motivated by his eugenics idea prompted appalling policies such as the involuntary sterilisation of the supposedly 'feeble-minded' as well as hostile immigration policies. Eugenics also helped set the scene for the Holocaust, and the sterilisation and murdering of homosexuals, convicts, and the mentally ill. It is clear that Galton's idea of eugenics had a major impact racist, homophobic and ableist notions in history, and even sparked a campaign in 2020 at University College London to decolonise the university by renaming their Francis Galton Lecture Theatre in vein of this.

"This article explores the lack of diversity in the STEM fields and that forensic sciences that can limit the types of questions being asked in research. Society demographics are highly dynamic, so without diversity of ideas, perspectives and experiences the field stagnates and does not keep up with important issues that are relevant to society. Students who read this will understand their value as diverse individuals who represent the diversity of wider society and that they bring their unique background and experiences to the table for the betterment of forensic science, to cater to the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of society and its needs. ""Striving for a culture of diversity through inclusion in forensic anthropology helps to reflect the greater populations that we serve and encourages us to challenge our own assumptions and inherent biases that can complicate the analysis of skeletal remains in forensic casework. Diversity and inclusion initiatives should be substantial and well-supported, rather than merely token gestures to increase the number of minorities or underrepresented groups.""

"Using bibliometric, web surveys and qualitative interview research, this study finds that despite positive signs that productive scientific research in Africa is improving, structural constraints such as continued reliance on international funding, lack of sufficient support and mentoring programs due to brain drain  ( emigration of skilled nationals, results in a depletion of skilled human resource in the countries of origin) in the previous century that the next generation require. The study implores international science funders, national african granting councils, and universities to take note of these findings and design appropriate interventions to address them. Makes students aware of the limiting factors affecting global south science students, and makes them aware of the privileges they have, having access to education in an institution enriched with financial and knowledge-sourcing resources.

"Hart and Slack discuss their experiences in the forensics field as forensic scientists of color, and how bias and under-representation can produce flawed forensic findings. After discussing their experiences in education and employment in the forensics field, they discuss how diversity and inclusion regarding gender, ethnicity, and race have impacted their occupational experiences and insights. One insight expressed is that although science is being objective and neutral in its methods and findings, there are certain areas of science where biases may exist, particularly regarding the physical characteristics of people. The forensic scientist’s perspectives and decisions, although influenced by scientific principles learned through education and experimentation, inevitably will be influenced by her/his personal background, distinctive knowledge, and socioeconomic experiences. Maximizing diversity in physical features and socioeconomic experiences in forensic scientists expands, balances, and restrains inevitable subjectivities in scientific decisions. It is important that students understand that different demongrpahics: race, gender, ethnicity, etc influence scientific inquiry. To avoid bias in forensic science inquiry and findings, it is imperative that diversity is well integrated within the discipline.","Hart and Slack discuss their experiences in the forensics field as forensic scientists of color.

Also this will broaden the cohort for researchers that extend to women, and provide them opportunity for collaboration and allow them the confidence and access to network with senior colleagues. This is an important tool for female students to use, as networking gives them the capacity to create a space, support and opportuntity to thrive in the work place that is currently dominated by men.

"Discuss how unconscious bias can be harmful, as it draws from personal experience, cultural environment and background to make instantaneous assumptions about our surroundings. This is because our mind uses instinct, not analysis. We judge people based on gender, and other social factors, and make snap judgements about whether people are like us: our 'ingroup' who we favour, or the less favourable 'outgroup'. This can cause disortion in scientific inquiry, so the Royal Society says it is imperative that we slow down and critically question decisions and question cultural stereotypes to tackle unconscious bias - 'we cant sure it, but we can address it'. Students need to understand the limiting psychological factors that affect scientific research and findings, so that research and science can be as unprejudice as possible. Making students slow down and question the research decisions, background, personal and cultural factors that the material they source, or themselves produce have will help them address unconscious bias, and will create more inclusive and unbias scientific inquiry.","Students need to understand the limiting psychological factors that affect scientific research and findings.

"Many of the case studies have female victims, who are mainly white.  (e.g., Lecture 1 slides: Emile Gourbin case, Lecture 3 slides: Joseph Sledge, Lecture 4: Pembrokeshire Murders, Week 4: Sarah Payne, Lecture 5 - Colin Pitchfork, Marilyn Reese Sheppard, Lecture 6 - Malcolm Fairley, Gary Ridgeway, Lecture 10 - Billie Jo Jenkins, Lecture 13 - Harold Shipman, ). Additionally, often the perpetrator is male and white. This may be distressing to female students who may feel their identity is often victimised, and that they are more vulnerable. It is understoofd that statistically, women are more at risk but it may be important to highlight other crimes against other demographics that are under-reported, i.e, sexual assault on men is often under reported. this may help  reduce out distress in female students, and  make all students aware of crimes that go under-reported.","Many of the case studies have female victims, who are mainly white.

"Making the diverse reading a small subsection only mentioned in the first week's slides can heavily implies that diverse reading is optional to students. It may be worth finding some good sources in the Padlet reading and intergrating this into the main list as a more meaningful way of diversifying the cirriculum rather than appending a small link in one slide for one week for diverse reading. This way, students may feel that the diverse reading is of more importance in the field and in their studies by highlighting the importance of minority voices in forensic science, rather than a secondary resource they can look into if they wish to. I have created a 'sub-review' of sorts, for the Padlet reading list in order to assess the extent the content and authors on the Padlet promote diversity and inclusion before taking steps to reccomend that it should be more visible on Moodle, and intergrated into the main reading list. Find the sheet 'Padlet Review'.",Diverse reading should be intergrated into the main reading list. Students may feel that the diverse reading is of more importance in the field and in their studies.

"There are very graphic images of a vaginal, perenium and anal swab conducted on a woman, it might be very upsetting to female students.  If it completely necessary to depict these, perhaps replacing some of the examination images of men aswell, so there is a sense of equity. It is understood that the rates of sexual offences against woman are higher, but there is a massive underreporting of sexual offences against men, and showcasing the examination for both may help students understand the realities of sexual offence statistics that go unreported, and it may also dampen the feeling of victimisation for female students. Slides 114 and 115 also include a diagram of a woman for notes after a sexual offences has been committed against them - perhaps replacing/adding a male body chart can help make this week's topic less focused on women as the sole object of sexual offences","There are very graphic images of a vaginal, perenium and anal swab conducted on a woman, it might be very upsetting to female students.
